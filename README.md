This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project, named My Payment gateway, where I'm using next js 15, tailwind css and supabase for authentication/backend.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
